Remember to write your thoughts as a book report.
I expect the same _content_ as your presentation, but the working should reflect the new medium.

# Read and Review

Individually read and review the paper.
As a group, please summarize your thoughts including the following:

1. How original is the topic?
2. What is the main question addressed by the research?
3. Are the conclusions consistent with the evidence and arguments presented?

# A.I Help

Pretend that ChatGPT (or similar tool) is a new team member.
Ask ChatGPT to contribute to the group project.
Keep diligent notes as to your conversation.
Science is about reproducibility, if your classmates can not repeat the process using your steps, you will be marked down in the next assignment.

# Compare and contrast

Compare and contrast what you, as a human team member, _understood_ to what ChatGPT, as an A.I. team member, _understood_.

1. Did ChatGPT help fill in your understanding of the paper?
2. Did ChatGPT miss the mark in a meaningful way?
